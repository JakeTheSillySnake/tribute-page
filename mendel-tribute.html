          <h2>Here are the events of Gregor Mendel's life:</h2>
          <ul id="events" class="events">
            <li><strong>1822</strong> - Born in Heinzendorf bei Odrau, Austrian Empire (now Czechia)</li>
            <li><strong>1840-1843</strong> - Studied philosophy and physics at the Philosophical Institute of the University of Olomouc</li>
            <li><strong>1850</strong> - Failed oral part of an exam to become a certified high school teacher</li>
            <li><strong>1851</strong>- Sent to the University of Vienna to study under the sponsorship of Abbot Cyril Franti≈°ek Napp</li>
            <li><strong>1853</strong> - Returned to the Augustinian St Thomas's Abbey in Brno as a teacher</li>
            <li><strong>1856-1863</strong> - Cultivated and tested ~28,000 plants, mainly pea plants. His experiments led to the Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment, now known as Mendel's Laws of Inheritance</li>
            <li><strong>1865</strong> - Presented his paper "Experiments on Plant Hybridization" at two meetings of the Natural History Society of Brno, which was positively accepted but produced no impact</li>
            <li><strong>1866</strong> - Mendel's paper published but was seen as being about hybridization rather than inheritance and, again, received little acknowledgment</li>
             <li><strong>1867</strong> - Replaced Napp as abbot of the monastery</li>
            <li><strong>1884</strong> - Died at the age of 61 in Brno from chronic nephritis</li>
            <li><strong>1900</strong> - Mendel's work was independently rediscovered by Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns and the results were replicated</li>
            <li><strong>1930s-1940s</strong> - Mendel's laws were combined with the Darwin-Wallace theory of natural selection, producing modern synthesis of evolutionary biology </li>
          </ul>
